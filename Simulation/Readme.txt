Purpose
This tool simulates the computation cost of a privacy-preserving 3D skyline query scheme.
It counts how many times each secure interface is called and multiplies this by the unit cost from the source paper to estimate the total computation cost.

The simulation includes three main phases:
Data Upload
Token Generation
Secure Skyline Query

Parameters
n: number of data objects
d: number of attributes
λ: security parameter
θ: leaf capacity
c: branch factor
m: landmarks
obstacles: number of obstacles
